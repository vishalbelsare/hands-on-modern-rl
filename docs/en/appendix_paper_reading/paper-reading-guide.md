# C.1 Learning Resources and Project Roadmap

> After completing the first 17 chapters of this book, readers have acquired all the mathematical and engineering foundations necessary to read cutting-edge reinforcement learning (RL) papers. However, the RL literature is vast—arXiv adds thousands of papers each year, but only a handful are truly direction-defining and worth rereading repeatedly. This appendix organizes these "must-read papers" by theme, with each paper annotated with a **one-sentence summary of its core contribution** and a **reading priority** (★ Must-read / ◆ Recommended / ◇ Extension), helping readers build a complete map of the literature from classical RL to the forefront of research in 2026.
>
> Reading suggestions: Build theoretical foundations in the order of C.1.1 → C.1.2 → C.1.3, then select relevant papers in C.1.4 and C.1.5 based on research interests. Each paper should be read again after hands-on implementation (see [Appendix A](../appendix_industrial_training/training-debugging), [Appendix B](../appendix_code_cheatsheet/sft-kl)), at which point readers will discover engineering details that were previously overlooked during the first read.

## C.1.1 Essential Reading in Classical RL

The value of classical literature lies not in the algorithms themselves—TD-Learning and Q-Learning are now textbook knowledge. Their true value lies in the **foundational proofs**: formalizing, analyzing, and proving the concept of "an agent learning in an environment." Reading these papers is the fastest way to understand the meaning behind all the mathematical notation in modern RL.

## C.1.2 Essential Reading on Deep Reinforcement Learning

After 2013, RL entered the era of deep learning. This set of papers defined the standard method stack for modern deep RL: experience replay, target networks, actor-critic, maximum entropy, and model learning. Readers should focus on mastering the **algorithm skeleton** and **ablation experiments** of each paper— the former determines whether one can reproduce the results, and the latter determines whether one can improve upon them.

## C.1.3 Must-Read Papers on LLM RL

LLM RL is the largest application of reinforcement learning (RL) after 2022. This set of papers defines core paradigms such as RLHF / DPO / GRPO / RLVR / R1 / DAPO, each corresponding to a segment of industry training practices. Readers should **read them in chronological order** to understand the evolution of algorithms: reward model → RLHF → DPO (without reward model) → GRPO (without critic) → R1 (pure RL) → DAPO (fixing GRPO's shortcomings) → the 2026 GSPO/CISPO.

## C.1.4 Essential Reading for Safety Research

RLHF / RLVR opens the Pandora's box of **reward hacking, deception, alignment camouflage, and latent backdoors** while making models stronger. This set of papers represents the core literature of AI safety research after 2023 — they explain **why well-trained models can harm you**, and the fundamental limitations of existing alignment methods. Any engineer working on post-training should at least read the first five papers in detail.

## C.1.5 2025–2026 Frontiers

Starting from 2025, RL enters its second boom period: process reward models drive reasoning, agent training paradigms mature, self-play extends to code and software engineering, and video generation introduces RL fine-tuning. These papers are mostly tech reports from 2025–2026 and have not yet entered mainstream textbooks—they define **the research directions for the next decade of RL**. Readers should pay close attention.

## Reading Path Recommendations

The optimal path varies for different readers:

- **From the Basics**: C.1.1 → C.1.2 → C.1.3 → C.1.4, to understand the full evolution of RL from 1992 to 2026 in chronological order.
- **For LLM Post-Training Engineers**: C.1.3 (entire) + C.1.4 (first five chapters) + C.1.5.1 (entire). Focus on the engineering details of InstructGPT, DPO, GRPO, R1, and DAPO.
- **For Agentic RL Researchers**: C.1.3 (GRPO/R1) + C.1.5.2 (entire) + C.1.2 (AlphaZero/MuZero/Dreamer) to understand search and world models.
- **For Safety Researchers**: C.1.4 (entire) + C.1.1 (Sutton & Barto, Chapter 15 on exploration and exploitation failure patterns) + C.1.3 (RLHF over-optimization related papers).
- **For Theoretical Researchers**: C.1.1 (entire) + C.1.2 (Rainbow/Dreamer ablation studies) + C.1.5 (GSPO/CISPO mathematical derivations).

## Reading Methods

::: tip Detailed Reading vs. Skimming
For **core algorithm papers** (marked with ★), do a detailed reading—read formulas line by line, reproduce code, and conduct ablation studies. For **engineering tech reports** (such as Qwen3, Kimi K2), do a skimming—focus on hyperparameter tables, training curves, and ablation results. The former trains your thinking, while the latter trains your engineering intuition.
:::

::: warning Do Not Only Read the Latest Papers
RL papers from 2025–2026 often assume readers are familiar with the details of GRPO/PPO/REINFORCE. If you skip C.1.1/C.1.2 and directly read C.1.5, you might feel that "the algorithms are not special"—in reality, this is due to a lack of historical context. It is recommended to trace each new algorithm back to its 2–3 "ancestral" papers.
:::

::: details Correspondence Between Papers and Chapters in This Book
The "Extended Reading" section at the end of each chapter in this book lists the core papers for that chapter. This appendix provides a more comprehensive map of papers across chapters. It is recommended to use this appendix in conjunction with the lists at the end of each chapter:

- [Chapter 14 DPO](../chapter17_dpo/dpo-objective-derivation) → C.1.3 Rafailov et al.
- [Chapter 8 PPO](../chapter10_ppo/ppo-clip-objective) → C.1.1 Schulman PPO, C.1.2 A3C
- [Chapter 13 RLHF](../chapter15_rlhf/base-model-to-assistant) → C.1.3 InstructGPT
- [Chapter 15 GRPO/RLVR](../chapter18_grpo/grpo-practice-and-mechanism) → C.1.3 R1, Shao et al.
- [Chapter 9 Continuous Control](../chapter11_continuous_control/deterministic-policy-gradient-ddpg) → C.1.2 DDPG/TD3/SAC/Dreamer V3
- [Chapter 25 Alignment Failures](../chapter30_alignment_failures/classical-failures) → C.1.4 All
- [Chapter 18 Industrial-Level LLM RL](../chapter16_llm_rl_industrial/single-machine-to-industrial) → C.1.5.3 All
  :::

## Chapter Summary

The 100+ papers in this appendix constitute a complete map of the reinforcement learning (RL) literature, from 1992 Q-Learning to 2026 Kimi K2.5. They are not a "read and forget" list, but rather a **resource to be revisited repeatedly, accompanying your professional growth** — each additional paper you understand deepens your comprehension of modern RL. When you can uncover an engineering detail that the author left unexplained in a paper, or identify an assumption that has not been ablated, you have the capability to conduct independent research.

## Supplement: Learning Resources and Reproduction Projects

> **This appendix's goal** is to provide readers with a clear navigation for their future advancement. The first half organizes theory-rich, accessible textbooks and course resources to help you systematically build a solid foundation or delve into the cutting edge. The second half outlines the classic milestones and commonly used environments in the game and simulation ecosystems of reinforcement learning, offering you inspiration and a coordinate system to find your next hands-on reproduction project.

### Recommended Learning Resources

> **How to Use This List**: This book covers the full chain from MDP fundamentals to PPO, DPO, and GRPO, but the RL field extends far beyond this. If you want to dive deeper into a particular direction, compare different teaching styles, or find resources to get started with hands-on practice, this list can serve as a starting point. All resources are free or publicly accessible.

**How to Use This List?**

### Recommended Projects for Reproduction

Reinforcement learning projects can be divided into two lines of development based on the era. The pre-LLM era focused more on fixed simulation environments, game benchmarks, continuous control, multi-agent systems, and model learning. The LLM era expanded the concept of actions to include tokens, tool calls, web operations, visual reasoning, and long-term agent trajectories. Rewards also evolved from environment scores to preference models, rule validation, process rewards, and real-world task success rates.

#### Pre-LLM Era and Fixed Environments, Simulations, and Classical Algorithms

This path is ideal for building a strong foundation in reinforcement learning. It is recommended to start with single-file implementations of small environments and gradually progress to Atari, continuous control, multi-agent, robotics, and model-based RL.

##### Getting Started with Unity ML-Agents

[Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) supports reinforcement-learning experiments inside a 3D game engine. Unlike a two-dimensional grid or a physics-only simulator, it can combine perspective, occlusion, gravity, collision, and programmable environments for visual navigation and spatial-reasoning tasks.

**Typical Use Cases**:

```python
# Unity ML-Agents can be wrapped with a Gymnasium-compatible interface.
from mlagents_envs.environment import UnityEnvironment

# Load a prebuilt Unity environment.
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="3DBall")

# Convert the ML-Agents API to a Gymnasium-style interface.
from mlagents_envs.gym_utils import UnityToGymWrapper
gym_env = UnityToGymWrapper(env)

# Train the wrapped environment with Stable-Baselines3.
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
model = PPO("MlpPolicy", gym_env)
model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
```

**Classic ML-Agents Environment Examples**:

| Environment   | Task Type                 | Difficulty | Suitable for Practice                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |

| Crawler       | Four-Legged Walk          | Medium     | Continuous control + multi-joint coordination |
| Walker        | Two-Legged Walk           | Medium     | Comparing with PyBullet's Walker2d            |
| PushBlock     | Push Block                | Beginner   | Goal-conditioned RL                           |
| FoodCollector | Food Collection           | Medium     | Multi-objective + navigation                  |
| HideAndSeek   | Multi-Agent Hide-and-Seek | Advanced   | Multi-agent emergent behavior                 |

#### The Age of LLMs and Post-Training, Reasoning, Agentic, VLM, and World Models

In the age of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL) is no longer just about "maximizing a score in a fixed environment." Actions can be a piece of text, a search, a tool call, a webpage click, a code patch, a visual localization, or even an entire multi-step agent trajectory. Rewards have expanded from environmental scores to preference models, rule validation, process rewards, unit tests, webpage task success rates, and multimodal grounding signals.

##### Modern and Classical Resource Quick Reference

The recommended reading order is to first study classical papers and official documentation to build a conceptual foundation, then choose a "small model + verifiable reward" project to run through, and finally move on to distributed training, deep research, GUI/Computer Use, and multimodal environments.

##### LLM Post-Training

LLM post-training primarily deals with "how to make the model more aligned with human preferences, task formats, and safety constraints." The key terms at this level are SFT, Reward Model, PPO, DPO, KTO, ORPO, RLOO, and GRPO. For beginners, it is recommended to first run TRL with a small model, and then move on to distributed training stacks such as OpenRLHF, verl, and NeMo-RL.

This direction requires a clear understanding of three things: **where the data comes from, how to give rewards, and how to update the policy.** SFT addresses "whether the model can answer in the required format," preference optimization addresses "which of two responses is preferred," and PPO/GRPO/RLOO address "how the model can improve further based on rewards after self-sampling." Many post-training projects fail not because of algorithm errors, but because these three aspects are mixed together: using SFT data to expect the model to explore, using preference data to expect the model to learn verifiable reasoning, or using overly simplistic rewards to expect the model to gain stable capabilities.

###### Reproduction Goals

###### Minimal Project Design

A minimal project can use an instruction-tuned model with 0.5B to 3B parameters. First apply supervised fine-tuning to a small instruction dataset, then run one round of preference optimization with DPO or KTO, and finally use PPO or GRPO with a rule-based reward or a small reward model. Keep a fixed set of 20–50 evaluation prompts at every stage. Track response length, format compliance, refusal rate, repeated phrasing, and human preference. These observations show which behaviors post-training actually changes, beyond the loss curve alone.

---

###### Choosing a Framework

Use TRL when the goal is to understand the algorithm: its trainer interfaces make the loss, reward, and KL terms easy to inspect. LLaMA-Factory and ms-swift reduce setup time for quick experiments, especially with Chinese-language and multimodal models. For industrial training systems, study OpenRLHF, verl, and NeMo-RL. They expose the interactions among rollout generation, optimization, inference engines, weight synchronization, memory, and throughput.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Only Looking at Reward Curves**: An increase in reward does not necessarily mean an improvement in quality. It could simply indicate that the model is producing longer answers, using more sophisticated formatting, or relying on more fixed templates.
- **Skipping Fixed Evaluation Sets**: Without a fixed prompt, it is difficult to determine whether the model is genuinely improving or if the observed changes are due to sampling randomness.
- **Ignoring KL Divergence and Length**: Post-training often pushes models toward a local optimum characterized by being long-winded, conservative, and repetitive.
- **Directly Applying Large Frameworks**: Without first thoroughly understanding the reward and loss dynamics in TRL, large-scale frameworks can amplify existing issues.

##### LLM Reasoning

The core of reasoning-based reinforcement learning is not to "make the answer more aligned with human preferences," but rather to "teach the model to learn verifiable reasoning processes in mathematics, coding, logic, and symbolic tasks." In this context, rewards can come from final answers, unit tests, format validation, symbolic execution, and process checking.

This direction differs from standard RLHF in a key way: rewards do not have to come from human preferences, but can instead be derived from a **verifier**. Math problems can be judged by answers, code problems can be tested by running the code, format problems can be validated by regular expressions, and symbolic problems can be executed by interpreters. As long as the verifier is reliable, the model can obtain training signals through extensive self-sampling. This is why works like RLVR, GRPO, and R1 are worth studying together.

###### Reproduction Goals

In the first stage, it is recommended to start with tasks such as Countdown, arithmetic problems, formatted JSON, and simple Python functions. The goal is not to chase rankings, but to personally observe four phenomena: the model explores different solution methods; incorrect answers may also have high-confidence reasoning; training is unstable when rewards are sparse; and once the verifier has a flaw, the model quickly exploits it.

In the second stage, transition to tasks such as GSM8K, MATH, code unit tests, or reasoning-gym generated tasks.

###### Project Structure

A clean reinforcement learning (RL) project for reasoning tasks should have at least five distinct file layers: task generation, answer parsing, reward function, rollout sampling, and training configuration. Avoid hiding the answer parsing logic within the reward function, as this will make debugging bad cases extremely difficult. After each training session, it is essential to sample and save the following: the question, the model's full output, the parsed answer, the standard answer, the reward, and the failure reason. This approach provides significantly more insight than simply looking at the average score.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Too Fragile Answer Analysis**: The model answers correctly but the analysis fails, or answers incorrectly but gets rewarded due to formatting loopholes.
- **Long Reasoning as Good Reasoning**: Longer reasoning may simply indicate the model has learned to procrastinate, not that the logic is more accurate.
- **Too Easy Training Set**: The reward quickly saturates, and the model only learns to use fixed templates.
- **Too Difficult Training Set**: Almost all rewards are zero, and the policy receives no gradient signals.

##### Deep Research RL

Deep Research RL focuses on "how models actively retrieve, read, filter evidence, and generate research-based answers." It differs from ordinary RAG in that the retrieval behavior itself is a strategy. The model must learn when to search, what to search for, which pages to read, how to cite evidence, and when to stop.

Ordinary RAG typically involves a one-time retrieval: the user asks a question, the system retrieves several documents, and the model generates an answer. Deep Research, on the other hand, resembles a multi-turn decision process: first, break down the question, retrieve the first set of documents, read them, identify gaps, reformulate the query, continue searching for evidence, and finally synthesize the findings into a report. The value of RL lies in training these intermediate decisions, not just the final text.

###### Reproduction Goal

Minimal reproduction does not necessarily need to start with real internet access. One can first prepare a static document library and encapsulate three tools: `search`, `open`, and `find`, allowing the model to complete multi-hop QA in a controlled environment. Rewards can be divided into four categories: whether the final answer is correct, whether citations come from real documents, whether the evidence supports the conclusion, and whether the number of tool calls is reasonable. Once this closed-loop system is stable, it can be migrated to BrowserGym, WebArena, or a real search environment.

###### Observation Focus

The logs of Deep Research are more important than the final answer. You should observe whether the model repeatedly searches for the same keyword, whether it only opens the top-ranked page, whether it cites sources it has not read, and whether it forces a conclusion when evidence is insufficient. A good agent is not only "correct" but should also demonstrate planning, cross-validation, revisiting when conflicts arise, and narrowing the scope of conclusions when evidence is lacking.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Rewarding Only the Final Answer**: In long-horizon tasks, rewarding only the final state makes credit assignment extremely difficult.
- **Using Citation Count as Quality**: Models may learn to stack links rather than support claims with evidence.
- **Unreproducible Real Web Pages**: Page changes, search ranking variations, and broken links can contaminate training results.
- **Ignoring Cost Constraints**: Infinite search can improve hit rates, but real systems must control latency and API call costs.

##### Agentic RL and Tool Invocation

In Agentic RL, actions are not only outputting tokens, but also invoking tools, executing code, browsing web pages, modifying files, querying databases, or interacting with external systems. The challenge lies in long trajectories, heterogeneous actions, delayed rewards, and complex failure types, making it more reliant on environment wrappers, trajectory segmentation, and verifier design compared to standard RLHF.

This direction can be viewed as "training a large language model within a stateful environment." At each step, the model outputs not only natural language but also tool names, parameters, code snippets, SQL queries, shell commands, or next steps. Training data is no longer single prompt-response pairs, but full episodes: states, actions, tool returns, environmental changes, rewards, and termination reasons must all be recorded.

###### Reproducibility Goals

For beginners, it is recommended to start with low-risk tools: calculators, file search, restricted Python execution, and text-world environments. First, let the model learn "when to invoke a tool," then "which tool to invoke," and finally "how to generate complex parameters." For code agents, unit tests can serve as rewards. For business process agents, database state satisfaction with constraints can be the reward. For web agents, task completion rate can be the reward.

###### Engineering Splitting

Do not start by writing the agent framework, environment, reward, and trainer all together. A more stable structure is: the environment is responsible only for executing actions and returning observations; the reward is responsible only for scoring; the trajectory store is responsible only for recording; and the trainer consumes only the transformed samples. Projects like Agent Lightning, AReaL, and SkyRL are worth looking at precisely because of how they split these boundaries.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Loss Based on Tool Output**: Tool outputs are not generated tokens by the model. The model should not be held responsible for the results of the tools.
- **Irrecoverable Environment State**: A single failure contaminates subsequent tasks, making the training data difficult to interpret.
- **Reward Too Late**: Only providing success or failure at the end makes it unclear to the model which step in the decision-making process went wrong.
- **Too Large Action Space**: Directly opening shell, browser, and file system can make exploration extremely inefficient.

##### GUI and Computer Use

The GUI/Computer Use direction expands the action space from tokens to include clicks, inputs, scrolls, shortcuts, window switching, and coordinate positioning. It differs from Deep Research's web reading, emphasizing real interface state changes, visual grounding, long-term operations, and task completion rates.

The challenge for GUI agents lies in the fact that "the same action description can be completely different under different screen states." Button positions change, popups appear, scroll regions may be obscured, and layouts differ between mobile and desktop interfaces. Therefore, the core here is not to have the model memorize the UI, but to align the model with screenshots, DOM, accessibility trees, historical actions, and task goals.

###### Reproduction Goals

It is recommended to start with behavior cloning or action ranking, rather than directly using reinforcement learning. Use environments like Mind2Web or BrowserGym, where the model selects the next action given a web state. Once the action format stabilizes, introduce online rollout and task success rewards. Desktop GUI and mobile GUI can begin with short tasks, such as opening settings, searching for information, and filling out simple forms, and then expand to multi-step cross-application workflows.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Coordinate Overfitting**: The model memorizes screen positions rather than understanding the semantics of controls.
- **Inconsistency Between Screenshots and DOM**: Elements visually visible may not be easily locatable in the DOM, and DOM elements may be occluded.
- **Evaluation Based Only on Final Page**: Some tasks require intermediate states to be correct, such as saving settings, submitting a form, or confirming an order.
- **Lack of Failure Classification**: Clicking the wrong button, not finding an element, inputting the wrong format, or slow page loading should be categorized separately.

##### VLM

In the direction of VLM (Vision-Language Model) reinforcement learning, the focus is on connecting visual understanding, language reasoning, and action grounding. Rewards can come from the correctness of text and image answers, OCR accuracy, bounding box or point localization, GUI click positions, robot task success rates, or from preference models like ImageReward.

VLM reinforcement learning is not merely "adding a reward to image-based question answering." It at least includes four types of tasks: visual question answering, spatial localization, GUI operations, and visual control. The rewards for these tasks are completely different: for QA, the reward is based on the answer; for localization, it is based on IoU or point error; for GUI tasks, it is based on whether the action changes the interface state; and for robots, it is based on whether the task is completed. When reproducing, it is essential to clearly identify the task type, otherwise the reward function may become a patchwork of unrelated components.

###### Reproduction Goals

The minimal project can start with text and image answer validation, for example, given an image and a question, let the model output answers in a fixed format, and use rules or external annotations for scoring. The next step is to perform grounding, where the model outputs a bounding box or a click point, and the performance is evaluated using IoU, distance error, or target hit rate. Finally, move on to GUI or robot tasks, as these tasks introduce continuous states, long-range actions, and real-world environmental noise.

###### Training Observations

VLM training must save visual bad cases. Saving only text logs is insufficient: you need to combine the original image, model annotations, target boxes, output answers, and the reward in one view. Many errors are not due to reasoning mistakes, but rather OCR errors, small target objects, coordinate system conversion errors, point displacement after image scaling, or the model being misled by irrelevant text in the image.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Only Looking at Text Accuracy**: Visual grounding may be wrong, yet the answer may still happen to be correct.
- **Confusion in Coordinate Systems**: When the original image size, model input size, and rendering size are inconsistent, bounding boxes or points are easily misaligned.
- **Data Leakage**: Some VQA benchmarks may have been seen during pre-training, so it is necessary to supplement evaluations with self-built or time-sliced data.
- **Uninterpretable Rewards**: When a preference model gives a high score, it should be possible to trace back what visual attributes were actually rewarded.

##### World Models and Simulators

A world model focuses on "whether an agent can learn an environment model that can be used for imagination and planning." In classical reinforcement learning, it connects model-based RL, planning, and sample efficiency; in the age of LLMs and agents, it can also serve as a controllable simulator for training long-horizon tasks, web/tool environments, and embodied intelligence.

The value of a world model is not to "replace the real environment," but to reduce the cost of trial and error. The agent first learns an approximate dynamics model from real interactions, then performs short rollouts, planning, or strategy improvements within the model. The key issue is always model bias: if the model has even a slight systematic error, the planner may repeatedly exploit this error, eventually learning strategies that are not applicable in the real world.

###### Reproduction Goals

For beginners, one can start by implementing a 2D continuous control or a variant of CartPole: collect real transitions, train a small model that predicts the next state and reward, and then compare the sample efficiency of model-free PPO/SAC with model-based rollouts.

For advanced study, one can look into DreamerV3, TD-MPC2, and MBPO: they respectively represent the three typical approaches of latent imagination, MPC planning, and short model rollouts.

###### Relationship with LLM Agents

In Agentic RL, the simulator can also serve as a "task world model": web snapshots, tool responses, user states, and database states can all be encapsulated into reproducible environments. This allows training to occur without needing to access real websites or real business systems each time; instead, the agent can be trained within pre-recorded state transitions. While such simulated environments cannot fully replace real-world environments, they are highly suitable for offline debugging, badcase replay, and course projects.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Too Long Model Rollout**: Prediction errors accumulate with the number of steps. Shorter rollouts are often more stable.
- **Only Report Final Score**: Also report the number of real environment samples, model training cost, and planning cost.
- **Ignore Uncertainty**: When the model is uncertain, the strategy may drift into regions where the model is least reliable.
- **Too Clean Simulation**: Robotics and GUI tasks, in particular, require noise, latency, occlusion, and random initial states.

##### Generative Model RL

Generative Model RL focuses on directly optimizing image, video, or multi-modal generation results using a reward function. It is similar to language RLHF, but the reward typically comes from aesthetics scores, image-text consistency, safety, preference models, or human/AI feedback.

One can view the sampling process of a diffusion model as a trajectory: starting from noise, going through multiple denoising steps, and finally obtaining an image. Rewards are typically computed only on the final image, such as aesthetics scores, text consistency, safety classification, human preference, or multi-modal model scores. The core of methods like DDPO is to incorporate the generation process into policy gradient, rather than only doing supervised fine-tuning.

###### Reproduction Goals

For a minimal project, one can choose a very narrow prompt set, such as "generate a clear single object," "generate an icon with a specified color," or "generate a simple scene that matches the text description." First, fix the base model and sampling parameters, then compare three types of rewards: CLIP/text consistency, aesthetics or preference scores, and normalized safety constraints. After each training, save before/after images for the same set of prompts and visually inspect whether the reward truly corresponds to quality improvement.

###### Common Pitfalls

- **Reward Model Exploitation**: The model may learn to generate certain high-scoring textures, compositions, or keywords styles, rather than genuinely aligning with human preferences.
- **Only Looking at Average Reward**: It is essential to examine image samples; otherwise, it is easy for the reward to increase while the quality decreases.
- **Too Narrow Prompt Coverage**: Over-optimization on a small prompt set can damage generalization and diversity.
- **Safety and Aesthetics Conflict**: Multi-objective reward functions require tracking each sub-score, and cannot rely solely on a weighted total score.

##### Evaluation Benchmarks and Projects

In the LLM era, doing RL often leads to more issues in evaluation than in training. A project should at least consider the final success rate, process quality, format constraints, reward hacking, length bias, data leakage, and sampling stability. The following benchmarks can serve as entry points for reproducing projects.

Evaluation should not only ask "Has the score increased?" but also "Where has it increased, what is the cost, and has it damaged other capabilities." A qualified reproduction experiment should at least include: a fixed dev set, an unseen test set, pre- and post-training comparisons, mean and variance of multiple samples, badcase classification, length statistics, and cost statistics. For Agentic/VLM/GUI tasks, it is also important to save complete trajectories for replay.

###### Acceptance Checklist

- **Final Metrics**: Accuracy, pass rate, task success rate, preference win rate.
- **Process Metrics**: Tool call count, proportion of invalid actions, proportion of repeated search, reference accessibility rate, code test failure types.
- **Stability Metrics**: Whether the system remains effective under different random seeds, sampling temperatures, and model sizes.
- **Safety Metrics**: Whether it is more likely to fabricate references, overstep tool calls, leak environment information, or break format constraints.
- **Cost Metrics**: Average token usage, average tool calls, average latency, and GPU/CPU costs for training and evaluation.

###### Badcase Template

Each direction is advised to maintain a `badcases.jsonl` or table, at least recording: task id, input, model output, reward, scoring rationale, failure type, reproducibility, and repair suggestions. For LLM RL, badcase is not an afterthought after training; it is the entry point for the next round of reward design, data filtering, and environment fixes.

##### Reproduction Order Recommendation

Start with a small model of 0.5B to 3B and observable tasks such as math, code, and format validation to observe reward hacking, length bias, and sampling temperature effects. Then migrate from TRL/TinyZero/Open-R1 to distributed frameworks such as verl/OpenRLHF. For Agentic RL, prioritize tasks with clear success rates such as search, web, and code; for VLM RL, prioritize scorable tasks such as text-image answers, localization, OCR, and GUI clicks; for world models and embodied directions, first run DreamerV3/TD-MPC2, then add visual and real-robot complexity.

###### A Stable Route

1. **Week 1: Rule-based Reward Tasks**
   Run a small verifiable task using TRL or TinyZero, such as Countdown, JSON formatting, or simple math. The goal is to understand rollout, reward, advantage, KL, length bias, and log saving.

2. **Week 2: Preference Optimization and Post-Training Comparison**
   Use the same small model to perform SFT, DPO/KTO, and PPO/GRPO comparisons. Do not change too many variables; only observe the impact of different training methods on the same batch of prompts.

3. **Week 3: Reasoning RLVR**
   Introduce Math-Verify, reasoning-gym, or code unit tests to upgrade the reward from "format correctness" to "answer verifiability." Focus on observing reward sparsity and verifier vulnerabilities.

4. **Week 4: Tool Invocation or Deep Research**
   Package a small search/reading environment, and record complete trajectories. Begin with offline trajectory replay, then move to online rollout.

5. **Week 5: VLM or GUI**
   Choose a visual question answering, bounding box localization, or web-clicking task, and add visual badcases. Focus on checking coordinate systems, screenshot states, and reward interpretability.

6. **After Week 6: Distributed and Industrial Frameworks**
   Then move into frameworks such as Verl, OpenRLHF, AReaL, and SkyRL. At this point, you will already know what reward, what logging, and what evaluation you need. You will not be led astray by engineering complexity anymore.

###### How to Determine When to Upgrade Difficulty?

When a task satisfies three criteria, you can move to the next level: first, the performance difference before and after training on a fixed evaluation set is stable; second, badcases can be clearly categorized; third, when the reward increases, the quality of manual sampling also improves. Otherwise, do not rush to switch to a larger model or a more complex environment. First, improve the reward, data, and logging.
