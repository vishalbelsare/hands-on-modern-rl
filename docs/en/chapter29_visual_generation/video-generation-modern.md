# 24.5 Why Videos Contradict Themselves: Video RLHF and Physical Evaluation

Consider a five-second clip of a red ball rolling behind a box and emerging on the other side. Every individual frame can look sharp while the clip still fails: the ball changes size, disappears too early, or emerges before it reaches the box. An image scorer sees several attractive frames. A viewer sees one broken event.

Video therefore changes the object we must evaluate. The model must preserve identity, motion, contact, and causal order across a timeline. A single terminal score can still train the model, but it cannot tell us which moment caused the failure, and a visually strong reward can hide temporal mistakes.

This section follows that problem from simple frame checks to video-specific rewards, [VADER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08737), [DanceGRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07818), Seedance, and LongCat-Video. We will finish with a small evaluation harness that can test physical consistency without first training a video model.

## 24.5.1 What a Timeline Adds

RL for image generation has matured ([DDPO](./visual-generation-dancegrpo), DPOK). However, video generation brings new challenges:

### Long Sequences

- **Image**: 1 image (1024×1024 pixels)
- **Video**: 30–300 frames (each 1024×1024), with a total data volume 30–300 times that of an image

The explosion in sequence length makes credit assignment in RL extremely difficult — in a 100-frame video, which frame or which pixel is problematic?

### Temporal Consistency

A video must not only look good in individual frames, but also be **temporally consistent** — the same person, the same scene, and continuous actions.

```text
Image reward: single-frame quality (clarity, aesthetics, prompt alignment)
Video reward: single-frame quality + temporal consistency + motion smoothness + physical plausibility
```

Video reward is significantly more complex than image reward.

### Computational Costs

- Image generation (diffusion): 50 denoising steps × single frame = several seconds
- Video generation: 50 denoising steps × 100 frames = several minutes

RL training requires many rollouts, so longer clips, higher resolution, and more denoising steps make each update substantially more expensive. The factor depends on architecture, compression, clip length, and parallelism; it should be measured rather than treated as one universal multiplier.

### Scarcity of Reward Models

Image reward resources include [LAION-Aesthetics](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-aesthetics/) and [PickScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01569). Video evaluation has fewer standardized public reward models because annotators must judge both frame quality and temporal behavior. Collection cost depends strongly on clip length and labeling protocol.

These challenges have slowed progress in video generation RL in 2024. The major industrial breakthroughs in 2025 come from two directions:

- **DanceGRPO**: Applying the GRPO idea to diffusion (image + video)
- **Seedance / LongCat**: Using RLHF-style training + engineering optimization

## 24.5.2 DanceGRPO and GRPO for Diffusion

[DanceGRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07818) (ByteDance Seed, 2025.05) is a significant breakthrough in diffusion RL. Its core contribution is: **applying the GRPO idea directly to diffusion training**.

### Core Idea of DanceGRPO

Reviewing [Chapter 15 GRPO](../chapter18_grpo/grpo-practice-and-mechanism):

- Generate G rollouts for the same prompt
- Compute the reward for each rollout
- Use intra-group normalization to obtain advantage
- No need for a critic

DanceGRPO applies this idea to diffusion:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. For the same prompt, let diffusion generate G videos │
│    (G is typically 4-8)                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Use the video reward model to score each video       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Intra-group normalization (subtract mean, optionally divide by std) to obtain advantage │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Use policy gradient to update the parameters of diffusion │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This process is almost identical to GRPO for LLMs — the only difference is:

- Rollouts for LLMs are token sequences
- Rollouts for diffusion are denoising trajectories

### Comparison between DanceGRPO and DDPO

- **Dimension — Advantage Estimation**
  - DDPO: Single rollout + reward
  - DanceGRPO: Normalization within group
- **Dimension — Requires Critic**
  - DDPO: No
  - DanceGRPO: No
- **Dimension — Training Stability**
  - DDPO: Moderate
  - DanceGRPO: Significant improvement
- **Dimension — Training Efficiency**
  - DDPO: Medium
  - DanceGRPO: High (group normalization strengthens reward signal)
- **Dimension — Applicable Model**
  - DDPO: Early diffusion
  - DanceGRPO: Modern video diffusion

Key advantages of DanceGRPO:

1. **A clearer reward signal** — comparing multiple videos generated from the same prompt reveals "which video is truly better," not just the absolute score.
2. **No critic needed** — it avoids a value model, consistent with GRPO for LLMs.
3. **More stable training** — group normalization avoids update jitter from inconsistent reward scales across prompts.

### Experiments with DanceGRPO

Byte Seed trained multiple video generation models using DanceGRPO:

The DanceGRPO paper reports experiments on image and video generation backbones under several reward signals. The useful evidence is the per-reward comparison and ablation, not a universal percentage that applies across models. DanceGRPO is one representative critic-free route for visual generation RL; differentiable-reward methods and preference optimization remain separate alternatives.

## 24.5.3 What the Seedance Technical Report Actually Shows

The [Seedance 1.0 technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09113) describes a staged system: large-scale pretraining establishes basic generation, continued training and fine-grained supervised fine-tuning improve data quality and instruction following, and video-specific RLHF further adjusts motion, temporal coherence, and preference. This evidence is more precise than inferring a complete training recipe from a product demo.

### Seedance's Training Process

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 1: Large-scale video pre-training                   │
│   - Billions of video-text pairs                         │
│   - Learning the basic distribution of videos            │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Phase 2: High-quality data SFT                           │
│   - Filtering high-quality videos (4K, professional shot)│
│   - Teaching the model what "high quality" means         │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Phase 3: Video-specific RLHF                              │

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│   - Data flywheel                                        │

```

### Reward Design in Seedance

The report motivates monitoring several dimensions separately. A practical video reward system may include the following signals:

**Component 1: Prompt Following**

Does the video content align with the prompt description? Scored using a video-text alignment model.

**Component 2: Aesthetic Quality**

Video aesthetics — composition, color, lighting. Scored using an aesthetic model.

**Component 3: Motion Quality**

Naturalness of motion — are the human actions and object movements physically plausible? Scored using a motion model.

**Component 4: Temporal Consistency**

Temporal consistency — are the frames in the video coherent across time? Scored using frame-to-frame similarity.

**Component 5: Human Preference**

Human preference — a reward model trained on RLHF preference data.

For teaching purposes, we can write a weighted reward template as

$$r_{\text{total}} = w_1 \cdot r_{\text{prompt}} + w_2 \cdot r_{\text{aesthetic}} + w_3 \cdot r_{\text{motion}} + w_4 \cdot r_{\text{temporal}} + w_5 \cdot r_{\text{human}}$$

Here the $w_i$ values express engineering trade-offs. This equation is a teaching template, not a claim that the report fixes one universal set of weights. A single total reward should always be accompanied by the separate curves, because one component can improve while another declines.

### Engineering Optimization of Seedance

**Optimization 1: Latent Diffusion**

Instead of training in the pixel space, training is conducted in the latent space (compressed using a VAE) — significantly reducing computational costs.

**Optimization 2: 3D Attention**

Rather than using attention on single frames, 3D attention (time × space) is employed — capturing temporal dependencies.

**Optimization 3: Classifier-free Guidance**

During training, prompts are randomly dropped (10–20%) so that the model learns unconditional generation. During inference, the guidance scale controls the strength of the conditional generation.

**Optimization 4: Flow Matching**

As an alternative to traditional diffusion, flow matching is used (which is more stable and efficient). This has become a popular diffusion alternative since 2024.

### Performance of Seedance 1.0 Pro

VBench 2025.10 Ranking:

- **Model — Seedance 1.0 Pro:** 86.7%
- **Model — Wan 2.5:** 84.2%
- **Model — Kling 2.0:** 83.1%
- **Model — Hailuo 02:** 81.5%
- **Model — Sora 2 (OpenAI):** 80.8%
- **Model — Veo 3 (Google):** 79.5%

Seedance is the state-of-the-art video generation model in China, surpassing Sora 2 and Veo 3.

## 24.5.4 LongCat-Video and Efficient Long-Video Generation

[LongCat-Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22200) (Meituan, 2025.10) is another important work — focused on **long-video generation**.

### Challenges of Long-Video Generation

Standard video generation lasts 5–10 seconds. LongCat-Video aims for **more than 30 seconds**, bringing new challenges:

- **Context Explosion**: The latent representation of a 30-second video is massive.
- **Story Coherence**: Long videos need to tell a complete story, not just fragments.
- **Computational Cost**: Generating a 30-second video takes more than six times longer than a 5-second video.

### Design of LongCat-Video

**Design 1: Chunked Generation**

The long video is divided into multiple 5-second chunks, each generated independently, but with **overlap regions** to maintain coherence:

```text
Chunk 1: [0-5s]
Chunk 2: [4-9s]  ← Overlaps with Chunk 1 in [4-5s]
Chunk 3: [8-13s] ← Overlaps with Chunk 2 in [8-9s]
...
```

The generated results in the overlap region are averaged to ensure smooth transitions.

**Design 2: Story-level Reward**

It is not only frame-level reward, but also **story-level reward** — using an LLM to evaluate whether the video tells a coherent story.

```python
def story_reward(video, prompt):
    # Use LLM to evaluate the narrative quality of the video
    frames = sample_frames(video, n=10)
    description = vlm.describe(frames)
    story_quality = llm.judge_story(description, prompt)
    return story_quality
```

**Design 3: Hierarchical Diffusion**

Two-level diffusion:

- **High-level**: Generate the "skeleton" (key frames) of the video.
- **Low-level**: Interpolate to generate intermediate frames based on the skeleton.

This hierarchical structure is consistent with the hierarchical RL approach in [DeepSWE's hierarchical RL](../chapter23_rl_based_swe/world-model-and-deep-swe).

### Performance of LongCat-Video

LongCat-Video achieves state-of-the-art results in long video generation:

- **Model — Sora 2**
  - 30-Second Video Consistency: 65%
  - Story Coherence: 60%
- **Model — Veo 3**
  - 30-Second Video Consistency: 68%
  - Story Coherence: 65%
- **Model — Wan 2.5 Long**
  - 30-Second Video Consistency: 70%
  - Story Coherence: 68%
- **Model — LongCat-Video**
  - 30-Second Video Consistency: **78%**
  - Story Coherence: **75%**

## 24.5.5 Hailuo and MiniMax Video Generation

[Hailuo](https://hailuoai.video/) (MiniMax, released in September 2024, upgraded in July 2025, version 02) is another Chinese video generation SOTA.

### Features of Hailuo

- **Strong Motion Capture**: Excels in scenarios involving human actions, dance, and sports
- **Physics Simulation**: Relatively accurate simulation of gravity, collisions, and fluids

- Large-scale pre-training
- High-quality SFT
- DanceGRPO-style RL
- Expert iteration

Internal research at MiniMax (e.g., [CISPO](../chapter18_grpo/grpo-family)) also contributes to the training of Hailuo — the stability of CISPO in low-precision training makes large-scale video RL feasible.

## 24.5.8 A Minimal Harness for Physical Consistency

We can test the central failure modes without training a video model. Start with 20 prompts, each describing one observable event: an object passes behind an occluder, a cup receives water, a ball bounces after contact, or a person picks up one named object. Generate several clips per prompt and keep the seed, sampler, resolution, frame rate, and model version fixed.

For each clip, save four kinds of evidence:

- **Identity:** does the same object keep its color, shape, and count?
- **Trajectory:** does its position change continuously rather than teleport?
- **Contact order:** does contact occur before the resulting motion or deformation?
- **Task completion:** does the requested event actually finish?

Suppose the ball is at horizontal positions 8, 12, and 15 in three consecutive frames. The changes are 4 and 3, which is plausible under smooth motion. Positions 10, 12, and 2 would contain a sudden jump. A simple trajectory diagnostic is

$$
e_{\text{motion}}=\frac{1}{T-2}\sum_{t=2}^{T-1}
\left\|p_{t+1}-2p_t+p_{t-1}\right\|_2,
$$

where $p_t$ is the tracked object position in frame $t$. This second difference measures abrupt changes in velocity. It is only a diagnostic: camera cuts and intentional impacts can create large values, so the metric must be read together with the prompt and annotated event boundaries.

Run the same harness before and after post-training. Report each physical dimension separately, include failure clips rather than only successful examples, and use human review on ambiguous cases. This makes it possible to distinguish “prettier frames” from “more coherent events.”

## Summary

Moving from images to video adds a timeline. Reward design must therefore preserve frame quality while measuring identity, motion, event order, and physical consistency. VADER propagates differentiable reward gradients, DanceGRPO compares groups under the same condition, and video RLHF learns from preference signals; each route pays a different compute and evaluator cost.

Technical reports such as Seedance and LongCat explain parts of modern training systems, while product demonstrations from Hailuo, Wan, Kling, Sora, and Veo show capabilities without revealing every training detail. A reliable reading keeps those two kinds of evidence separate.

The practical deliverable is the evaluation harness: fixed prompts and seeds, separate physical dimensions, repeated samples, ambiguous-case review, and retained failure clips. The next chapter, [Reward Hacking and RL Evaluation](../chapter30_alignment_failures/classical-failures), studies what happens when the evaluator itself becomes the object that optimization learns to exploit.
