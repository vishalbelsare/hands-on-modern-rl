## Overview

**Hands-On Modern RL** is an open course for learning modern reinforcement learning through practice. Instead of the usual "formula first, black-box API later" route, this course takes a **practice-first** path: learners begin with runnable code and observable training behavior, then use those concrete traces to understand states, value functions, policy gradients, reward modeling, credit assignment, and the rest of the mathematical structure behind RL.

The course spans classic control and connects directly to current AI frontiers, including large language model (LLM) post-training, preference alignment with DPO and GRPO, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), multi-turn tool-use agents, Agentic RL, and vision-language model (VLM) reinforcement learning.

The goal is to provide a solid ladder: from solving CartPole for the first time to building modern post-training and agent systems.

### Design Principles

The course is organized around these engineering and teaching principles:

1. **Practice before formalism.** Each major topic starts from experiments, metrics, failure cases, or implementation details, then introduces the mathematical abstraction.
2. **Theory explains behavior.** MDPs, Bellman equations, policy gradients, GAE, PPO clipping, DPO objectives, and GRPO-style group advantages are introduced as tools for explaining what the code does.
3. **Modern RL goes beyond classic RL.** The course covers classic control and deep RL, then moves into RLHF, preference optimization, RLVR, VLM reinforcement learning, and multi-turn agent training.
4. **Debugging is first-class.** Training collapse, reward hacking, KL drift, entropy decay, OOM failures, and evaluation blind spots are treated as core material.
5. **Readable systems beat black boxes.** Examples favor explicit implementations, inspectable metrics, and clear experiment boundaries so learners can modify and extend them.

### Audience

This course is for learners who want to understand reinforcement learning by building and inspecting working systems.

It is especially useful for:

- Machine learning engineers moving from supervised learning into RL.
- Researchers and students preparing to read modern RL and alignment papers.
- LLM practitioners interested in RLHF, DPO, GRPO, RLVR, and post-training systems.
- Builders of tool-use agents, web agents, code agents, and evaluation pipelines.
- Self-learners who prefer code, experiments, and visual intuition before dense derivations.

Recommended background:

- Python programming experience.
- Basic PyTorch familiarity.
- Introductory linear algebra, probability, and calculus for machine learning.
- Ability to read papers and trace open-source training scripts.

The course includes math review appendices, so full mathematical fluency is not required on day one.

### Learning Goals

After completing the course, learners should be able to:

- Implement and explain the core RL loop: environment interaction, trajectory collection, reward feedback, policy updates, and evaluation.
- Connect MDPs, value functions, Bellman equations, TD learning, policy gradients, and advantage estimation to concrete training behavior.
- Read and modify implementations of DQN, REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, PPO, DPO, GRPO, and related methods.
- Reason about LLM post-training pipelines, including SFT, reward modeling, PPO-style RLHF, DPO-family methods, and RLVR training.
- Understand multi-turn interaction and credit assignment, and build tool-use, trajectory-synthesis, and Agentic RL systems.
- Extend reinforcement learning ideas to VLMs, embodied intelligence, multi-agent self-play, and other frontier areas.
- Diagnose common RL failure modes and design reasonable algorithms, engineering evaluations, and debugging workflows for new RL problems.

## Recommended Learning Path

A practical path through the repository:

1. Read the [course guide](docs/preface/intro.md) and run the CartPole example.
2. Skim the DPO chapter early, even before finishing all theory, to anchor the motivation for LLM post-training.
3. Study Chapters 03-07 in order; this is the conceptual core.
4. After understanding policy gradients and PPO, return to RLHF, DPO, GRPO, and RLVR.
5. Use the debugging and engineering appendices whenever a training run behaves strangely.
6. Treat frontier chapters as extensions: VLM reinforcement learning, Agentic RL, continuous control, multi-agent systems, and test-time reasoning.

## Quick Start

### Read Online

Published course site:

```text
https://walkinglabs.github.io/hands-on-modern-rl/
```

### Run the Documentation Site Locally

Requirements:

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/walkinglabs/hands-on-modern-rl.git
cd hands-on-modern-rl
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local VitePress URL shown in the terminal, usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### Verify the Site

Before submitting a pull request that changes documentation structure, theme code, navigation, build scripts, or generated assets, run:

```bash
npm run verify
```

This checks formatting, lints the VitePress theme, builds the site, and verifies expected build artifacts.

### Run Course Code

Most code examples use Python and are organized by chapter.

```bash
cd code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For smaller installs, use chapter-specific requirements files:

```bash
pip install -r chapter01_cartpole/requirements.txt
python chapter01_cartpole/1-ppo_cartpole.py
```

Some chapters may require additional system libraries, GPU support, model downloads, or environment-specific setup. Start with Chapter 01 before running examples that involve LLMs, VLMs, or heavy simulators.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start the local documentation server
npm run build         # Build the static site
npm run preview       # Preview the built site locally
npm run format        # Format repository files with Prettier
npm run format:check  # Check formatting
npm run lint          # Lint VitePress theme code
npm run verify        # Run format check, lint, build, and artifact verification
```

## Contributing

Contributions should make the course clearer, more accurate, easier to reproduce, or easier to navigate.

Good contributions include:

- Fixing conceptual errors, formulas, diagrams, broken links, or typos.
- Improving explanations without changing the intended learning path.
- Adding small, reproducible experiments that clarify existing chapters.
- Improving scripts, build reliability, navigation, or accessibility.
- Adding high-quality references to papers, official documentation, or widely used open-source implementations.

Please keep pull requests focused. A good PR usually changes one chapter, one experiment, one group of diagrams, or one infrastructure issue at a time.

When adding content:

1. Put course material under [`docs/`](docs/).
2. Use kebab-case for new directories and files.
3. Prefer directory-based routes with `index.md`.
4. Update [`docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`](docs/.vitepress/config.mjs) when adding navigable pages.
5. Run `npm run verify` before requesting review if your change touches config, theme, scripts, or generated site output.
6. Use Conventional Commits, such as `docs: clarify ppo clipping` or `fix: repair chapter link`.

For repository-specific maintenance rules, see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
