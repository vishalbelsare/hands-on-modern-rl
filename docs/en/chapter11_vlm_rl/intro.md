# VLM Reinforcement Learning

In earlier chapters, we pushed RL from classic control to LLM post-training:

- DQN learns from pixels in Atari,
- PPO stabilizes policy updates,
- DPO/GRPO optimize language models with preference signals or verifiable rewards.

Most of those settings share a simplifying assumption: there is only one input modality (state vectors, pixels, or text tokens).

The real world is not text-only. You see images, screenshots, charts, videos, and 3D scenes. Before you can reason and act, you must first **understand visual evidence**. Vision-language models (VLMs) bring images and language into a single model. RL then asks a harder question:

Can we use outcome feedback to make the model not only describe images, but _see more accurately, reason more reliably, and answer more truthfully_?

Moving RL from text to multimodal models is not "just add image tokens." Once you train seriously, you run into a set of problems that do not appear in text-only RL:

1. **Who is responsible for an error?** If the answer is wrong, was the vision encoder wrong, or was the language reasoning wrong?
2. **Should the vision encoder be updated by RL?** Update too aggressively and you can degrade vision (the model "goes blind"); freeze it completely and you cannot improve visual ability.
3. **Will the model pretend it saw the image?** If guessing can get reward, RL can reinforce visual hallucinations.
4. **How does vision connect to action?** In driving, robotics, and GUI agents, visual outputs affect real decisions. Safety and latency become training constraints.

This chapter opens these issues in a progressive way: first a minimal GRPO experiment to build intuition, then the special challenges of VLM RL, then frameworks that connect experiments to real applications, and finally RL post-training for visual generation models.

## VLM RL vs Text-Only RL

In text-only RL, inputs and outputs are tokens. If an answer is bad, we usually ask one question: did the generated tokens match the reward target?

In VLM RL, there is a visual pipeline:

image -> vision encoder -> visual tokens -> multimodal fusion -> language reasoning -> output.

So training becomes "see correctly, then reason correctly." A single scalar reward does not automatically tell you where the failure came from. This is the core credit-assignment problem in multimodal RL.

## Learning Path

This chapter is organized as: run something minimal -> see the new problems -> understand systems -> extend to generation.

## Learning Goals

After this chapter, you should be able to:

- map VLM RL back to the same RL primitives you already know (policy, trajectory, reward, KL constraints),
- explain why multimodality changes reward design and credit assignment,
- identify the typical failure modes (visual hallucination, encoder collapse, mis-grounding),
- and evaluate whether a VLM is truly using visual evidence rather than language priors.
